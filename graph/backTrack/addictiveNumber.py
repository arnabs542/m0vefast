Example 1:

Input: "112358"
Output: true
Explanation: The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.
             1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8
Example 2:

Input: "199100199"
Output: true
Explanation: The additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199.
             1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199
