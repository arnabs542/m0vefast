# path sum
- pathsum1: root to leaf to target (boolean), (all)
  - eg: bianry tree all path dfs
- pathsum2: node to node to target (all) (one path)
  - 以每个node 为root, apply pathsum1
- pathsum3: https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iv/

# max path sum
- diameter/longest: node to node
    - update max with left+right
    - return height/single path

- max path 1: node to node (no constrain)
    - update max with root+left+right
    - return single path
- max path 4: node to node (one path)
    - update max with root + max(left,right)
    - return single path
- max path 2: leaf to leaf (child discurssion)
    - can not get rid of neg value
    - update max only has 2 child,
    - return single path





3) max path 0: root to node
6) max path 3: leaf to root
8) has path sum: node to node (one path)  ?
