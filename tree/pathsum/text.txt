# path sum
- pathsum1: root to leaf to target (boolean), (all)
  - eg: bianry tree all path dfs
- pathsum2: node to node to target (all) (one path)
  - 以每个node 为root, apply pathsum1
- pathsum3: https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iv/


# max path sum
- max path length: node to node
- max path 1: node to node (no constrain)

3) max path 0: root to node

5) max path 2: leaf to leaf
6) max path 3: leaf to root
7) max path 4: node to node (one path)
8) has path sum: node to node (one path)  ?
